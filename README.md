# A23-24 ICT GROUP MOBILE APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT - Group Project
## Topic 19. Security Camera System

## 📝 Description
This project is a GUI-friendly application that allows users to watch and manage security camera(s). The application is written in (Java or Kotlin) and using some libraries for media encode/decode.

## 📝 Project Status
We started this project from Sep 11, 2023 and not yet finished (more information can be found in the commit history). The project was initially planned to be finished in 2 weeks with basic GUI and functions. We're in the development stage, so lots of bugs will exist.

The commit history will not showing the real contribution of each member. We had a lot of discussions at the library to decide what to do for each project's progress. 
In order for the members not to create many structurally different pieces of code, we decided to focus on a single machine (leader's potato machine) during almost all development stages.
